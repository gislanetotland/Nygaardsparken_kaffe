            <h3 id='nomads'>Nomads Kitchen</h3>
        
            <article class="text">
                <p>Nomads Kitchen was born in 2019 out of my passion to create a 
                    magical delicious synergy and stories around my food with the local 
                    community of Bergen, to create and inspire memories and nostalgia which 
                    could be in a sustainable and edible bowl made of bread holding a cheesy 
                    comforting soup or a plate of Baked Potatoes with raclette or a mexican 
                    inspired tostada with homemade pickles. 
                    Or perhaps in New York style chewy Bagels with fillings from around the 
                    globe based on my memories and experiences. </p>
                <p>Then there is also my homemade cakes or hot chocolate which bring waves 
                    of koselig warmth and have already won many hearts.
                     On the other hand my Wienerbrød requires intense technical knowledge 
                     and patience to laminate a flaky pastry which takes two days to make 
                     and acts as a platform to hold a delicious array of flavours based on 
                     my interpretation and creativity. I am constantly innovating and 
                     creating to offer something unique which you will not easily find 
                     in Bergen, which only Nomads Kitchen has to offer, homemade with love.
                </p>
                <p>My kitchen is my canvas and butter and flour or vegetables and beans 
                    are my tools with which I create the foundations for comfy soulful 
                    bites or a piece of flavourful textural art inspired by my travels and 
                    memories. To create my dishes a lot of planning, experimenting and 
                    thought goes behind the scenes, to create new flavours and dishes. 
                    A lot of sourcing of quality ingredients from all over town which 
                    are available locally and can help manifest my vision through my food.</p>
                <p>Why Nomads Kitchen? I was born a Nomad, an explorer and traveller 
                    who has always been on the move to live and learn and my next 
                    goal dream is to travel around Norway with my kitchen and table 
                    to host pop ups and events to connect people through my food….</p>

            <article class="text">
                <p>NyDeli was a dream come true that started after meeting with Odd Erik Dahl 
                    the activity coordinator for Nygårdsparken. He has been instrumental in 
                    giving us the opportunity to express our creativity and build a concept 
                    and been an immense pillar of strength guiding us all along the way. </p>
                <p>My background with a masters in microbiology and work experience in 
                    quality control helped me to get an approval from Mattilsynet, the 
                    norwegian food safety authority. I received a lot of encouragement 
                    from my husband’s work colleagues who regularly ordered take away from us. </p>
                <p>Although food and cooking has been my passion since I was a child I had 
                    formal education in Microbiology and had cooked for a maximum of 
                    30 people before. I ended up cooking for 100 people and we had almost 
                    150 visitors! For the first time in my life I had cleaned and prepared 
                    10 kilos of lamb, almost 7 kilos of potatoes and 5 kilos of rice.</p>
                <p>NyDeli has given all of us a chance to share our culture and food with 
                    the local community. We have celebrated many Indian festivals like Holi 
                    and Diwali at the park with tremendous response and participation from 
                    fellow indian migrants as well as those from many other countries and 
                    native norwegians. </p>    
                <p>What is unique about NyDeli is the fact that people always feel that they 
                    get to experience authentic Indian cuisine as they would in an Indian home 
                    and that's what appeals most to them.

                <p>Verdenskafeen in Nygårdsparken is part of Kafe Mat & Prat. Kafe food and chatter
                    is New Chance's work training initiative. The work is led by experts
                    chefs who provide training in work in the kitchen and canteen. The trainees get

                <p> We are based on the trainees' food culture, and that's what it is
                    forms the basis of what we have on our menu in the park. We have great faith in
                    that food provides a good arena for learning and integration. And not least, that our
